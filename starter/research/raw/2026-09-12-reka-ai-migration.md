# Origin and scope

Source: `/Users/alexanderopalic/Projects/reka-ui-bench-mark`, clean checkout at `ab4207bf38e4f72feb08f9202fd3eed97f728fbe`. Full prompt document and selected verbatim operating-manual excerpts below. Inspected source, not a new execution or benchmark. Repository documents report 97 destinations: 87 browser and 10 Node; original jsdom files remain a comparison corpus.

# PORT-PROMPTS.md — complete source

# PORT-PROMPTS.md — the two prompts the fan-out runs on

`PORTING.md` §6 specifies the per-file loop: one implementer, one reviewer, separate context
windows, then the machine decides. This file holds the actual prompts, because the most
transferable lesson from the Bun playbook is **fix the prompt, not the code** — and you cannot
fix a prompt that was improvised into an agent call and then thrown away.

When a batch produces a bad port, the change goes here, and the batch re-runs. Every edit to
this file should say what went wrong in the changelog at the bottom.

`{COMPONENT}` is the component key (`Separator`, `shared/useForwardProps`, …).
`{FILE}` is the jsdom file, repo-relative from `packages/core/src/`.

## Implementer prompt

> You are porting one jsdom test file in the reka-ui fork at
> `/Users/alexanderopalic/Projects/reka-ui-bench-mark` to Vitest Browser Mode.
>
> **Your file: `packages/core/src/{FILE}`. Port it to `packages/core/src/{COMPONENT}.browser.test.ts`.**
>
> **Read `AGENTS.md` first, in full.** It has the translation table and the gotchas list, and
> the gotchas are all things that already cost someone an hour. Then read
> `PORTING.md` §2 (the three oracles), §5 (the verdict column — note `found-gap`, for when the
> port is green and that is precisely the problem) and §6 (the rules for agents). Do not skip these on the
> grounds that your file looks small — the smallest file ported so far, a 79-line `Label` test,
> produced three findings.
>
> ### What you produce
>
> 1. `packages/core/src/{COMPONENT}.browser.test.ts`
> 2. One or more rows appended to `FINDINGS.tsv` at the repo root.
>
> **The findings row is not paperwork, it is the deliverable.** A batch that produces green
> files and no findings has failed. If the port genuinely taught you nothing, say that in the
> row and say what you checked to conclude it — "ported cleanly" on its own is a non-answer.
>
> ### Hard rules — these are machine-enforced, you will not get away with breaking them
>
> - **Verbatim `describe` and `it` names.** `port:parity` diffs the name tree and fails on any
>   name in your port that is not in the original. Do not rename, do not "clarify", do not fix
>   a typo.
> - **Never weaken an assertion to get a green tick.** Softening `toHaveAttribute` into
>   `toBeInTheDocument`, disabling an axe rule, deleting the assertion that fails — these are
>   the same move, and this entire apparatus exists to catch it. `port:parity` counts `expect`
>   calls per test and fails on any test that now runs fewer than the original.
> - **If the port fails because it found something real, quarantine it — do not fix it.**
>   ```ts
>   // @finding {FILE}#some-key
>   it.fails('exact original name', async () => {
>     // body unchanged — do NOT weaken the assertion that fails
>   })
>   ```
>   `.fails`, not `.skip`, so the body still runs and still contributes coverage, and so the
>   test turns red the day someone fixes the bug. The `@finding` key must exist in the first
>   column of `FINDINGS.tsv` or `port:parity` fails the file. Quarantine always costs you a
>   written finding; that is the point.
> - **Change nothing but test files.** Not component source, not story fixtures, not config.
>   A port that surfaces a real bug is a success, and its deliverable is a finding plus a
>   quarantined test, never a patch.
> - **Never `git stash`, `git reset`, `git checkout`, or any git command that does not commit a
>   named file.** Other agents are working in this tree concurrently and you will destroy their
>   work.
> - **Never leave the `unit` (jsdom) project broken.** It runs alongside the browser project on
>   purpose. You are adding a file, not replacing one — **keep the original `.test.ts`.**
> - Run vitest scoped to your file only. Never run the full suite.
>
> ### Two things that will bite you immediately
>
> - **`render` throws on `attachTo`.** Drop the option; do not translate it to
>   `container: document.body`. If every test in your original mounts with
>   `attachTo: document.body`, a literal port crashes on the first one.
> - **`getByText` matches a SUBSTRING here.** `@testing-library`'s matches the whole string. Pass
>   `{ exact: true }`. `getByText('checked')` otherwise returns the element reading `unchecked`,
>   and your toggle test passes against a component that never toggles.
> - **A locator is lazy — `getBy*` does not throw.** In a `@testing-library` original the throw *is*
>   the assertion. Translate a bare `getByTestId(…)` to
>   `await expect.element(…).toBeInTheDocument()`, or the test has no assertion left.
> - **Portalled content (Dialog, Popover, Select, Tooltip, Toast, menus) is reachable from BOTH
>   `screen.getBy*` and `page.getBy*`** — they return the same node. `render`'s helpers bind to
>   `baseElement`, which defaults to `document.body`. Only `screen.container` and `screen.locator`
>   are container-scoped. The trap runs the other way: because the helpers are document-scoped,
>   `screen.getBy*` also matches **other renders** in the same test.
> - **A `attributes('x')` assertion may be testing jsdom, not the platform.** Vue writes a DOM
>   *property* rather than an attribute whenever `key in el`, and jsdom's IDL setters reflect into
>   the content attribute where Chromium's often do not. If an attribute assertion fails in the
>   browser, check `el.x` before concluding the port is broken — and quarantine rather than
>   switching the assertion to the property.
>
> ### The part that is actually hard
>
> A ported test that goes green proves nothing — it may be green because it asserts nothing.
> Assume that of your own work and go looking. Two specific things to check before you claim
> the file is done:
>
> - **Was the original test vacuous?** `Slider`'s axe test called `axe()` synchronously after
>   `mount()`, before Vue flushed, so the only interactive element still had `display: none`,
>   axe skipped it, and the rule came back `inapplicable`. A green test asserting nothing. If
>   your file has an axe test, **probe `results.passes` / `results.inapplicable` /
>   `results.incomplete` in BOTH environments** and say in the finding which rules actually ran.
>   Three notes, all learned by measurement:
>   - **Read `incomplete` too.** Under jsdom `color-contrast` lands in `incomplete` with *zero
>     nodes*, not in `inapplicable`. A census reading only the other two buckets reports "the rule
>     ran" when nothing was examined.
>   - **Expect the answer to be "not vacuous."** `Slider` was vacuous for a specific reason — an
>     element hidden at mount time. `Progress` and `Toolbar` both turned out fine. A negative
>     result here is the normal one and is worth stating plainly.
>   - **`color-contrast` is usually the only rule browser mode adds**, and it is not a formality:
>     `Progress` measured 4.85:1 against a 4.5:1 threshold.
> - **Could the test fail at all?** Separate from vacuity, and more damning. Mutate the component
>   — delete the attribute or handler the test is about — and check the test goes red. `Separator`'s
>   only test survives **deleting `role="separator"` entirely**: zero violations *and* zero passes,
>   green either way. If your test cannot fail, that is a `found-gap` row.
> - **Is your ported test vacuous?** If a test asserts a negative ("does not focus", "does not
>   emit"), check that it can distinguish — construct the positive case in a throwaway probe,
>   confirm it behaves differently, then delete the probe. `Label`'s two negative click tests
>   would both have passed against a component that did nothing at all.
> - **Did a retrying matcher widen a timing assertion?** This is the likeliest way a mechanically
>   correct T2 port gets quietly weaker, and **the oracle cannot catch it** — the assertion count
>   goes up, not down. `Progress` has `describe('after 200ms')` with a synchronous
>   `expect(wrapper.html()).toContain(…)`; translated to `await expect.element(…)` it passes
>   anywhere inside the sleep *plus* the retry budget, and would stay green if the fixture flipped
>   at 900ms. When a `describe` name mentions a duration, assert **twice** — retrying matcher to
>   settle the flush, then the original's exact synchronous read.
>
> **A green oracle is not the finish line.** All three files in the first batch came back
> `0 lost, 0 gained`, and every real result came from probing past the oracles — mutating the
> component to see whether the test could fail, reading the istanbul map for code no test reaches

> your report is three green ticks and nothing else, you stopped too early.

## Reviewer prompt

> You are reviewing one jsdom → browser-mode test port in the reka-ui fork at
> `/Users/alexanderopalic/Projects/reka-ui-bench-mark`.
>
> **Read exactly these two files and nothing the implementer wrote about them:**

> - `packages/core/src/{COMPONENT}.browser.test.ts` — the port
>
> You may also read `AGENTS.md` for the translation table, and the component source to check a
> claim. **Do not read the implementer's reasoning or its `FINDINGS.tsv` rows before forming
> your own view** — you are the independent check, and the whole value of this role is that
> your context is clean.
>
> Your brief is not "does this behave like the original". It is:
>
> > **Does this test still test anything?** Assume the port is worse than the original and find
> > how.
>
> Specifically hunt for:
>
> - An assertion that got weaker — a narrow matcher swapped for a broad one, an exact-HTML
>   comparison replaced by a single-attribute check, a `toBe` become a `toBeTruthy`.
> - A test that now passes vacuously — it would pass against a component that did nothing.
>   Would this test fail if the feature were deleted? If you cannot say yes, say so.
> - A deleted jsdom mock replaced by a browser workaround that is *more* artificial than the
>   mock was.
> - A `.element()` synchronous read racing Vue's flush where an awaited `expect.element` was
>   needed. `expect.element` retries; `.element()` does not.
> - A `waitFor` / `setTimeout` / arbitrary sleep papering over a race.
> - A quarantined `it.fails` that is hiding a genuine porting mistake rather than a real bug in
>   the library. Read the linked finding and decide whether it is an explanation or an excuse.
> - Setup moved into `beforeEach` in a way that changed what the test sees — spies that no
>   longer accumulate, state that no longer persists across tests.
>
> **You do not implement.** Report what you found, ranked by how much it matters, and say
> explicitly for each item whether you verified it by running something or only by reading. If
> the port is sound, say so plainly and name the two or three things you checked hardest — a
> review that finds nothing is a useful result, but only if it says what it looked for.

## Changelog

Every entry here should be a batch that went wrong and the prompt change that fixes it.

- **Initial version** — extracted from the Phase 1 trial runs (`useForwardExpose`, `Label`,
  `Slider`), which were driven by hand. The implementer prompt's "the part that is actually
  hard" section is written directly from the two ways those three files nearly went wrong: the
  vacuous-original case (`Slider`'s axe test) and the vacuous-port case (`Label`'s two negative
  click tests).

- **After T2 batch 1** (`Separator`, `Progress`, `Toolbar`) — validated, and it held: three
  agents, three clean ports on the first try, all oracles green, no weakened assertions, and 8
  findings. No prompt change was needed to prevent a bad port. Four additions, all of which the
  batch had to discover the hard way:

  1. **The axe vacuity check needs to read `incomplete` too.** Under jsdom `color-contrast` lands
     in `incomplete` with *zero nodes*, not in `inapplicable`, so a census reading only `passes`
     and `inapplicable` reports "the rule ran" when nothing was examined.
  2. **Say that the vacuity check cuts both ways.** The prompt led with `Slider`, and two of three
     agents had to establish for themselves that their original was *not* vacuous. Worth stating
     that a negative result is the expected one.
  3. **Warn about the retrying matcher.** `Progress` nearly shipped a mechanically-correct
     translation that silently widened a 200ms timing assertion by the retry budget. The oracle
     cannot catch this — assertion count goes *up*. This is now a gotcha in `AGENTS.md`, and it is
     the single most likely way a T2 port gets quietly weaker.
  5. **Both silent vacuities now have prompt lines** (substring `getByText`, lazy `getBy*`), added
     after `Switch` found them. These are the two failure modes that pass `port:parity` while the
     test stops testing, so they matter more than anything else in this file.
  6. **Portalled content needs `page.getBy*`.** `AlertDialog` — `screen` is container-scoped, so an
     overlay port querying through `screen` matches nothing and fails in a way that looks like a
     component bug. **← WRONG, and corrected after batch 4. See below.**
  4. **Tell them a green oracle is not the finish line.** All three files came back `0 lost,
     0 gained` and every real result came from probing beyond the oracles — mutating the component
     to see if the test could fail, reading the istanbul map for code no test reaches. Batch 1's
     three most valuable findings are about the *test suite*, not the components.

- **After T2 batch 4** (`RovingFocus`, `Teleport`, `Toggle`) — three clean ports, all oracles green
  first try, 16 findings. No prompt change was needed to prevent a bad port. The change that *was*
  needed is of a new kind, and it is the reason this changelog exists:

  1. **A prompt line was factually wrong, and the batch caught it.** Entry 6 above told agents that
     `screen.getBy*` is container-scoped and cannot see portalled content. `Teleport` measured the
     opposite; the claim was then settled against `AlertDialog`'s own fixture — content's parent is
     `BODY`, `container.contains(content)` is `false`, and `screen.getByRole('alertdialog')` still
     returns **the same node** `page` does — and corroborated from `vitest-browser-vue` source
     (`baseElement` defaults to `document.body`; the helpers bind to it). The prompt line is now
     replaced, `AGENTS.md` is corrected, and the misleading comment in the `AlertDialog` port is
     rewritten. **The failure mode to notice: a wrong rule that errs toward extra work is nearly
     invisible.** Agents obeyed it, their ports stayed green, and the oracles had nothing to say —
     because using `page` where `screen` would do costs nothing but a wrong belief. It would have
     been inherited by all eight T3 overlays.
  2. **Therefore: findings are evidence, not verdicts.** Two rows from earlier batches were
     re-verdicted by this one — the portal claim, and `Toolbar#roving-focus-untested`, which
     overstated its gap (`RovingFocus` re-measured across all 12 consumer suites in one istanbul run
     and found the functions *are* reached; what is actually dead is narrower and better specified).
     Nothing in the apparatus checks a finding's *reasoning*, only a port's structure — so a
     plausible wrong cause survives a batch and ships to the next one. When a finding is the kind
     that generalises to many files, measure it twice.
  3. **Two `AGENTS.md` gotchas needed qualifiers rather than rewrites**, both from originals doing
     something the rule did not anticipate: `userEvent.tab()` polyfills tab order in JS
     (`getTabDestination.js`), so "tab-order tests are unportable from jsdom" holds only for raw
     keydowns; and `color-contrast` — "the one rule browser mode adds" — is `inapplicable` in
     Chromium too when the fixture has no text, which is the normal shape of a headless-library
     fixture. Both were stated too absolutely because each came from a single file.

# PORTING.md lines 1–10 — verbatim excerpt

# PORTING.md — how the jsdom → browser-mode port actually runs

This is the operating manual for **giving every test a non-jsdom destination**. All 97 original
test files now have one: the 87 that touch the DOM have Vitest Browser Mode counterparts, and
the 10 that do not run in a plain `node` project. By explicit project-owner decision, the 87
original jsdom files remain runnable as a comparison corpus; completion means no contract lacks
a browser or node destination, not that the `unit` project is empty.
`AGENTS.md` says *what this fork is for* and holds the translation table and the gotchas.
This document says *how the work is sequenced, what proves it worked, and what you do next*.


# PORTING.md lines 34–67 — verbatim excerpt

> A ported browser test that goes green proves nothing. It may be green because it
> asserts nothing.

That is not a hypothetical failure mode — it is the *default* one. An agent asked to make
`Slider.browser.test.ts` pass will, when a test is awkward, quietly drop an assertion,
soften `toHaveAttribute` into `toBeInTheDocument`, or rename the test to something it can
satisfy. Every one of those goes green. Fan out 64 agents against 97 files with no oracle
and you get 97 green files and zero information.

So the first job was not sharding or worktrees. It was **building an oracle**. That is
done — see the next section.

### The second reason: green files are not the deliverable

Per `AGENTS.md`, this fork exists to *learn browser mode* and to *record where jsdom was
the right call*. A fan-out that emits only ported test files throws that away. Every unit of
work here has to emit a **finding**, not just a file. See [FINDINGS.tsv](#5-findingstsv--the-actual-output).

---

## 2. The oracle — three checks, already built

Tooling lives in `packages/core/scripts/port/`. All of it is AST-based (TypeScript compiler
API), not regex, so `it.each`, template-literal names and nested describes are counted
correctly.

### 2.1 Structural parity — `port:parity`

```bash
pnpm --filter reka-ui port:parity            # every ported pair
pnpm --filter reka-ui port:parity Slider     # one component
pnpm --filter reka-ui port:parity Slider --complete
```


# PORTING.md lines 436–460 — verbatim excerpt

## 6. The per-file loop

One implementer, one reviewer, separate context windows. The reviewer never implements; the
implementer never reviews its own work.

**The two prompts live in `PORT-PROMPTS.md`.** They are a file rather than something typed per
batch for one reason: the most transferable lesson in the Bun post is *fix the prompt, not the
code*, and you cannot fix a prompt that was improvised into an agent call and discarded. When a
batch produces a weakened port, the change goes there and the batch re-runs — and the file has a
changelog so the next reader learns what went wrong rather than just inheriting the fix.

**Implementer gets:** the jsdom file, `AGENTS.md` (translation table + gotchas), the file's
row from `PORT-INVENTORY.tsv`. Produces `X.browser.test.ts` plus a `FINDINGS.tsv` row.

**Reviewer gets:** both files and nothing else — none of the implementer's reasoning. Its
brief is *not* Bun's "does this behave like the original." It is:

> **Does this test still test anything?** Assume the port is worse than the original and
> find how. Look for: an assertion that got weaker; a deleted mock replaced by an even more
> artificial browser workaround; a test that now passes vacuously; a `.element()` sync read
> racing Vue's flush where an awaited `expect.element` was needed.

**Then the machine decides:** `port:parity <Component>` and `port:coverage <Component>` must
both exit 0, and `port:checklist <Component>` says how much of the original is actually there.
Human judgement is for the finding, not for whether the port is sound.
